## Description: 
We would design an escape game, which includes kinds of general concepts in other similar games, such as discovering various clues and items, mysterious traps and baits, different versions of endings. To motivate the players to continue the game, this escape game will include the respawn function with random respawn points instead of restarting the current state. 

## Features / Functions: 
1. Generation of random game sets or events
   - Random respawn point
   - Magic items (dice) for random rewards/penalties
2. Data structures for storing game status
  - A display bar to display the items in the backpack & update with the items received
  - Commands to display player current position (Paper map exists but without position update)
3. Dynamic memory management
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)
5. Program codes in multiple files
6. Proper indentation and naming styles [Indentation style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style)
7. In-code documentation
